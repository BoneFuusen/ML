# Development of a Web-application(dashboard) for ML model inference and data analysis

## Description
This project is an interactive web page to visualize and predict whether a person has suspected diabetes based on 22 signs.
It includes several trained machine learning models and has a user-friendly interface.
The web page is developed using Streamlit library and is hosted on streamlit.Cloud hosting platform
